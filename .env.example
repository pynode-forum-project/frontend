### Frontend environment variables example
#
# Copy this file to `.env.local` (or `.env`) during development and adjust values.
# Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to client code.

# Enable client-side mock auth responses for local development.
# When `VITE_MOCK_AUTH=true`, the frontend will simulate login/register responses
# and will not call the real backend for auth. Set to `false` to hit the Gateway.
VITE_MOCK_AUTH=true

# Example: if you later use a local Gateway running on a different origin,
# you can configure other VITE_ variables here (not required by current setup).
